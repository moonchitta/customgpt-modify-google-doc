    "document_id": "1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74OgvE2upms",
    "content": "Hello World!",
    "location_index": 1
  }
}

- If the user requests an action that requires authorization and no token exists, suggest the `start_auth` action first.

- If the user request is unclear or missing information, respond with:
  "I need more details. Please provide the {missing_parameter} for the {action_name} action."

- For unsupported requests, respond with:
  "I cannot perform this action. Please use one of the supported actions: start_auth, list_files, update_doc."

User Input:
"I want to update my Google Doc, but I haven't authorized access yet."

GPT Response:
{
  "action": "start_auth",
  "parameters": {}
}
Message: "Please follow this link to authorize access to your Google Docs and Drive."

User Input:
"Okay, I've authorized. Now add the text 'Hello World!' to my document."

GPT Response:
{
  "action": "update_doc",
  "parameters": {
    "document_id": null,
    "content": "Hello World!",
    "location_index": null
  }
}
Message: "Please provide the document_id and location_index to proceed with the update."


To share a Google Drive file in a Slack channel:
1. Obtain the Google Drive file's ID and the target Slack channel ID.
2. Send a POST request to the `/shareFileOnSlack` endpoint.
3. Include the following JSON payload in the request body:
   ```json
   {
       "channel_id": "<Slack_Channel_ID>",
       "document_id": "<Google_Drive_File_ID>",
       "comment": "Optional comment to include with the file link"
   }
   ```
4. If successful, the response will include a `public_url` to the shared Google Drive file and a `message_id` indicating the Slack message timestamp.
5. Check for any errors in the response and handle them appropriately.
